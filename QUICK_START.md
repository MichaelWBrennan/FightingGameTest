# Quick Start - Fighting Game UI

## 🎮 **Immediate Implementation**

The fighting game UI is now fully integrated and ready to run immediately. No tests, no demos - just the actual game.

## **How to Run**

1. **Build the game:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## **Game Modes Available**

The UI automatically shows after boot with these core fighting game modes:

- **📖 STORY MODE** - Single player campaign
- **🕹️ ARCADE MODE** - Classic arcade experience  
- **👥 VERSUS MODE** - Local and online multiplayer
- **🎯 TRAINING MODE** - Practice and skill improvement
- **🏆 ONLINE MODE** - Competitive online play
- **🥋 CHARACTER SELECT** - Choose your fighter
- **⚙️ SETTINGS** - Game configuration

## **UI Features**

- **GG Strive-style layout** with prominent character showcase
- **Clean section cards** for each game mode
- **Immediate navigation** - click to access modes directly
- **No feature lists** - just the essential game modes players need
- **Automatic initialization** - UI shows after boot sequence

## **Technical Implementation**

- **PlayCanvas Engine** - Full 3D fighting game engine
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Event-driven architecture** - Clean separation of concerns
- **State management** - Proper game state handling
- **Service container** - Dependency injection system

The advanced features (Bayesian ranking, AI coaching, accessibility options, etc.) are still in the codebase and accessible through the appropriate game modes when implemented, but they don't clutter the main UI.

## **Development**

- **Watch mode:** `npm run dev` (rebuilds on file changes)
- **Production build:** `npm run build:prod`
- **Type checking:** `npm run typecheck`
- **Linting:** `npm run lint`

The game is ready to play immediately with a clean, focused UI that prioritizes the core fighting game experience.
