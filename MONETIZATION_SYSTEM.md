# Gacha-Free Monetization System

This document describes the comprehensive monetization system implemented to replace character DLC with ethical, transparent cosmetic-only monetization.

## Core Design Principles

✅ **No gacha, loot boxes, or random rewards**  
✅ **No in-game currencies** - all purchases use real currency for transparency  
✅ **All fighters free and permanently available**  
✅ **No gameplay-affecting monetization** - cosmetics only  
✅ **Anti-FOMO mechanisms** with vault access for limited content
