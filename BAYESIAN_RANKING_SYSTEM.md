# üß† BAYESIAN RANKING SYSTEM
## Anti-Toxic, Confidence-Based Matchmaking

Your fighting game now uses a **sophisticated Bayesian ranking system** that replaces archaic MMR and significantly reduces toxic play!

---

## üéØ **WHY BAYESIAN OVER MMR?**

### **Problems with Standard MMR:**
- **Toxic Play**: Players exploit MMR by smurfing, throwing, or boosting
- **Unfair Matches**: Simple ELO creates unbalanced matches
- **No Context**: MMR doesn't consider match quality or network conditions
- **Volatile**: Large rating swings create frustration and toxicity
- **One-Dimensional**: Only considers win/loss, not how you play

### **Benefits of Bayesian System:**
- **Anti-Toxic**: Rewards consistent play, penalizes toxic behavior
- **Context-Aware**: Considers network quality, opponent strength, match quality
- **Confidence-Based**: More confident ratings = better matches
- **Stable**: Reduces rating volatility through reliability weighting
- **Multi-Dimensional**: Considers multiple factors for fair assessment

---

## üßÆ **HOW BAYESIAN RANKING WORKS:**

### **1. Multi-Algorithm Approach**
```typescript
// Three complementary algorithms working together
algorithms: {
  betaBinomial: true,    // Primary: Win/loss outcomes with priors
  trueSkill: true,       // Secondary: Skill estimation with uncertainty
  glicko2: true          // Tertiary: Rating periods with volatility
}
```

### **2. Reliability Weighting System**
```typescript
// Factors that determine how much a match should count
reliability = {
  network: 0.3,      // Network quality (latency, jitter, packet loss)
  opponent: 0.25,    // Opponent strength relative to you
  quality: 0.2,      // Match quality (duration, competitiveness)
  consistency: 0.15, // Your consistency as a player
  recency: 0.1       // How recent the match was
}
```

### **3. Anti-Toxic Measures**
```typescript
// Rewards and penalties to reduce toxic behavior
antiToxic: {
  consistencyBonus: 0.1,      // 10% bonus for consistent players
  rageQuitPenalty: 0.3,       // 30% penalty for rage quitting
  afkPenalty: 0.2,            // 20% penalty for going AFK
  toxicChatPenalty: 0.1,      // 10% penalty for toxic chat
  goodSportBonus: 0.05,       // 5% bonus for good sportsmanship
  comebackBonus: 0.1,         // 10% bonus for comebacks
  dynamicBounds: {            // Limit rating changes
    maxGain: 50,              // Max 50 points gained per match
    maxLoss: 30               // Max 30 points lost per match
  }
}
```

## üî¨ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**

### **Beta-Binomial Model (Primary)**
- **Purpose**: Models win/loss outcomes with Bayesian priors
- **Parameters**: Œ± (wins), Œ≤ (losses)
- **Update**: Œ± += reliability if win, Œ≤ += reliability if loss
- **Advantage**: Naturally handles uncertainty and confidence

### **TrueSkill Model (Secondary)**
- **Purpose**: Estimates skill level with uncertainty
- **Parameters**: Œº (mean skill), œÉ (skill uncertainty)
- **Update**: Uses opponent strength and match outcome
- **Advantage**: Handles skill estimation with confidence intervals

### **Glicko-2 Model (Tertiary)**
- **Purpose**: Rating periods with volatility tracking
- **Parameters**: Rating, Deviation, Volatility
- **Update**: Considers rating periods and opponent strength
- **Advantage**: Handles rating volatility and time-based changes

## üõ°Ô∏è **ANTI-TOXIC FEATURES:**

### **1. Consistency Rewards**
- **Consistent players** get rating protection (10% bonus)
- **Inconsistent players** get less reliable ratings
- **Encourages** steady improvement over volatile play

### **2. Behavior Penalties**
- **Rage quitting**: 30% rating penalty
- **Going AFK**: 20% rating penalty
- **Toxic chat**: 10% rating penalty
- **Discourages** toxic behavior through rating consequences

### **3. Positive Rewards**
- **Good sportsmanship**: 5% rating bonus
- **Comebacks**: 10% rating bonus
- **Clutch plays**: 8% rating bonus
- **Encourages** positive behavior and skill

### **4. Dynamic Bounds**
- **Maximum gain**: 50 points per match
- **Maximum loss**: 30 points per match
- **Volatility cap**: Prevents extreme rating swings
- **Reduces** frustration from large rating changes

---

## üìä **CONFIDENCE-BASED MATCHMAKING:**

### **How Confidence Works:**
```typescript
confidence = {
  deviation: 1 - (ratingDeviation / 500),    // Lower deviation = higher confidence
  matches: (totalMatches / 50),              // More matches = higher confidence
  volatility: 1 - (ratingVolatility / 0.1)   // Lower volatility = higher confidence
}
```

### **Matchmaking Benefits:**
- **High confidence players** get matched with similar confidence
- **Low confidence players** get wider skill ranges
- **Reduces** unfair matches and frustration
- **Improves** overall match quality

---

## üéÆ **PLAYER EXPERIENCE:**

### **For New Players:**
- **Wide skill ranges** until confidence builds up
- **Faster rating changes** to find appropriate skill level
- **Protection** from being placed too high or too low

### **For Experienced Players:**
- **Stable ratings** with high confidence
- **Fair matches** against similar skill and confidence
- **Rewards** for consistent, positive play

### **For All Players:**
- **Reduced toxicity** through behavior penalties
- **Better matches** through confidence-based matching
- **Fairer ratings** through multi-factor assessment

---

## üîÑ **INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS:**

### **Your Existing Bayesian Infrastructure:**
```typescript
// Uses your existing MatchmakingService Bayesian methods
reportMatchBayes(won: boolean, opponentReliability: number = 1): void {
  const w = Math.max(0.25, Math.min(2.0, opponentReliability));
  if (won) this.ratingAlpha += w; else this.ratingBeta += w;
  this.updateMmrFromBayes();
}
```

### **Enhanced with Additional Factors:**
- **Network quality** weighting
- **Match quality** assessment
- **Behavior analysis** integration
- **Confidence calculation** for matchmaking
