# Fighting Game Platform - Balance Philosophy

## Core Principles

### 1. Competitive Integrity
The Fighting Game Platform prioritizes fair competition above all else. Every design decision must pass the test: "Does this enhance or diminish competitive fairness?"

**Non-Negotiables:**
- No pay-to-win mechanics
- All characters competitively viable
- Consistent frame data and hitboxes
- Transparent systems and mechanics

### 2. Anti-Power-Creep Stance
The platform maintains strict anti-power-creep policies to ensure long-term competitive health.

**Power-Creep Prevention:**
- New characters cannot exceed established damage ceilings
- Speed and mobility have defined upper limits
- Health pools remain within established ranges
- Meter gain rates are strictly regulated

**Established Limits:**
- Maximum single-hit damage: 200 (excluding supers)
- Maximum health: 1200
- Maximum walk speed: 200 units/frame
- Maximum meter per combo: 75 points

### 3. Risk/Reward Consistency
Every offensive option must carry proportional risk. High reward actions require high risk investment.

**Risk/Reward Matrix:**
- **High Risk/High Reward**: Slow, powerful attacks with long recovery
- **Medium Risk/Medium Reward**: Standard special moves and combo starters
- **Low Risk/Low Reward**: Safe pokes and defensive options
- **No Risk/No Reward**: Movement and basic defensive actions

## Character Archetype Balance

### Shoto (Fundamentals)
**Design Intent:** Balanced, fundamentals-focused characters that teach proper neutral game

**Stat Guidelines:**
- Health: 950-1050
- Walk Speed: 140-160
- Damage Per Combo: 180-250

**Required Tools:**
- Mid-range projectile (moderate startup, recovery)
- Anti-air special move (invincible, punishable on whiff)
- Combo starter (safe on block, limited reward)

**Balance Constraints:**
- Cannot have the fastest walk speed
- Cannot have the highest health
- Must have clear weaknesses in pressure or zoning

### Rushdown (Pressure)
**Design Intent:** High-speed pressure characters with strong mix-up options

**Stat Guidelines:**
- Health: 850-950
- Walk Speed: 160-200
- Damage Per Combo: 160-220

**Required Tools:**
- Fast overhead option (reactable but threatening)
- Command dash or movement special
- Frame trap sequences

**Balance Constraints:**
- Lower health to compensate for speed
- Limited range on normal attacks
- Meter-dependent for highest damage

### Grappler (Power)
**Design Intent:** High-damage, high-health characters with limited mobility

**Stat Guidelines:**
- Health: 1100-1200
- Walk Speed: 120-140
- Damage Per Combo: 250-350

**Required Tools:**
- Command grab (high damage, specific range)
- Armor move (limited use, high startup)
- Strong anti-projectile option

**Balance Constraints:**
- Slowest movement in the game
- Vulnerable to zoning
- Limited combo potential outside of grabs

### Zoner (Control)
**Design Intent:** Stage control through projectiles and long-range normals

**Stat Guidelines:**
- Health: 900-1000
- Walk Speed: 130-150
- Damage Per Combo: 140-200

**Required Tools:**
- Multiple projectile types (different speeds/angles)
- Long-range normal attacks
- Anti-rushdown defensive option

**Balance Constraints:**
- Weak up-close options
- High recovery on projectiles
- Limited meter gain from zoning

### Technical (Complexity)
**Design Intent:** High-execution characters with unique mechanics

**Stat Guidelines:**
- Health: 850-1050 (varies by specific design)
- Walk Speed: 130-180 (varies by specific design)
- Damage Per Combo: 180-300 (execution-dependent)

**Required Elements:**
- Unique mechanic that requires skill to utilize
- High execution barrier for maximum effectiveness
- Clear skill expression through gameplay

**Balance Constraints:**
- Power locked behind execution barriers
- Clear counterplay options for unique mechanics
- Cannot invalidate other archetypes

## System Balance

### Meter System
**Design Philosophy:** Meter should enhance gameplay options without creating unfair advantages

**Meter Gain Rules:**
- Attacking: 3-5 points per hit
- Taking damage: 8-12 points per hit
- Blocking: 1-2 points per blocked hit
- Special actions: Variable based on risk

**Meter Usage:**
- EX Specials: 25-50 meter
- Super Moves: 100 meter (full bar)
- Roman Cancels: 50 meter
- Defensive options: 25 meter

### Combo System
**Damage Scaling Philosophy:** Longer combos should provide diminishing returns

**Scaling Rules:**
- No scaling: First 3 hits
- 90% scaling: Hits 4-6
- 80% scaling: Hits 7-10
- 70% scaling: Hits 11-15
- 60% scaling: Hits 16+

**Combo Limits:**
- Maximum combo length: 20 hits
- Maximum wall bounce: 1 per combo
- Maximum ground bounce: 1 per combo
- Maximum air reset: 1 per combo

### Roman Cancel System
**Design Intent:** Create additional offense/defense options with meter investment

**RC Types and Costs:**
- Red RC (on hit/block): 50 meter
- Blue RC (on whiff): 37 meter (25% discount)
- Yellow RC (during recovery): 63 meter (25% penalty)
- Purple RC (after projectile): 25 meter (50% discount)

**RC Limitations:**
- Maximum 2 RCs per combo
- Cannot RC during super freeze
- 60-frame cooldown between RCs

### Parry & Defense System
**Design Philosophy:** Reward precise defensive timing without making offense obsolete

**Parry Windows:**
- Perfect Parry: 1 frame (maximum reward)
- Standard Parry: 6 frames (good reward)
- Just Defend: 3 frames (moderate reward)

**Parry Rewards:**
- Perfect: +12 frame advantage, 25 meter
- Standard: +8 frame advantage, 15 meter
- Just Defend: +4 frame advantage, 10 meter

## Balance Update Cadence
