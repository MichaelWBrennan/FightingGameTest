## Our Promise

We built this game because we love fighting games and the communities they create. These rights represent our promise to maintain that love and respect in everything we do. Your enjoyment, growth as a player, and trust in our community are worth more than any short-term revenue.

When the industry adopts exploitative practices, we choose a different path. When others prioritize engagement over enjoyment, we choose to respect your time and autonomy. When companies treat players as sources of revenue, we choose to treat you as the passionate gamers you are.

This is our commitment to you. Hold us to it.
