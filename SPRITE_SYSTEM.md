## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced File Structure
```

├── [character]_idle_enhanced.png     # Enhanced (256x384) ⭐
├── [character]_walk.png              # Original (64x96)

```

### Smart Loading System
The enhanced Character.cs automatically loads high-quality sprites with fallback support:

```csharp
// Smart sprite loading with quality preference
private void LoadCharacterSprite()
{
    // Try enhanced version first, fallback to original
    string enhancedSpritePath = $"res://assets/sprites/street_fighter_6/{CharacterId}/sprites/{CharacterId}_idle_enhanced.png";
    string originalSpritePath = $"res://assets/sprites/street_fighter_6/{CharacterId}/sprites/{CharacterId}_idle.png";
    
    string spritePath = ResourceLoader.Exists(enhancedSpritePath) ? enhancedSpritePath : originalSpritePath;
    
    if (ResourceLoader.Exists(spritePath))
    {
        var texture = GD.Load<Texture2D>(spritePath);
        if (texture != null && CharacterSprite != null)
        {
            CharacterSprite.Texture = texture;
            GD.Print($"Loaded sprite for {CharacterId}: {spritePath}");
        }
    }
}
```
