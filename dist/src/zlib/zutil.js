// Placeholder for other utility functions from zutil.c if needed.
// Many of these are macros, compiler-specific conditional code, or platform-specific memory functions
// that might not translate directly or be necessary in a standard TypeScript environment.
// For example, z_error, zmemcpy, zmemcmp, zmemzero, zcalloc, zcfree would need careful consideration
// regarding error handling, memory management, and platform compatibility if they were to be implemented.
// The original zutil.c contains platform-specific memory allocation functions (zcalloc, zcfree)
// and byte manipulation macros/functions (zmemcpy, zmemcmp, zmemzero) that are often
// handled differently or are built-in in JavaScript/TypeScript environments (e.g., Array.prototype.slice, Buffer methods).
// We will not implement those directly unless a specific need arises later.
