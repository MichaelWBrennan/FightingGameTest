## üîß Configuration Details

### vercel.json Configuration
- **Static builds**: All HTML files served as static content
- **Routing**: Main route (/) redirects to index.html
- **Headers**: Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- **Caching**: Assets cached for 1 year for optimal performance

### Assets Handling
- All assets in the `assets/` folder are served statically
- Images, JSON metadata, and other resources accessible via URL
- Optimized caching for asset files

## üåê Live Demo URLs

After deployment, your demos will be available at:
- Main showcase: `https://your-site.vercel.app/`
- Character select: `https://your-site.vercel.app/character_select_demo.html`
- Graphics demo: `https://your-site.vercel.app/pseudo_2d5_demo.html`
- And all other HTML files...

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Run the verification script to ensure everything is ready:
```bash
./deploy-check.sh
```

This will verify:
- ‚úÖ All required configuration files exist
- ‚úÖ HTML demo files are present
- ‚úÖ Assets directory is accessible  
- ‚úÖ JSON configuration files are valid
- ‚úÖ File sizes are web-optimized

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**404 Errors**: 
- Ensure all HTML files are in the root directory
- Check that asset paths are correct and relative

**Slow Loading**:
- Large assets are cached via headers in vercel.json
- Consider optimizing images if needed

**Missing Demos**:
- Verify files weren't excluded by .vercelignore
- Check the deploy-check.sh output

### Local Testing
```bash
# Start local server to test before deployment
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```
