# Fighting Game Starter - Design Document

## üéØ Vision Statement

Create a modern, live-service fighting game platform that prioritizes competitive depth, fair monetization, and community engagement. The game serves as an evolving platform for continuous content delivery without traditional sequel fragmentation.

## üéÆ Core Design Principles

### 1. Depth Over Complexity
- Easy to learn fundamentals with deep mechanical systems
- Clear visual feedback for all game states
- Intuitive control scheme that scales from casual to competitive

### 2. Fair Monetization
- **No loot boxes** - Direct character purchases only
- **No pay-to-win** - All characters competitively viable
- **No soft currencies** - Real money transactions only
- **Transparent pricing** - Clear value propositions

### 3. Platform Longevity
- Single evolving game instead of sequels
- Backward compatibility for all content
- Persistent player progression and unlocks
- Long-term competitive support

## ü•ä Combat System Design

### Inspired by Killer Instinct (2013)

#### Combo Structure
The combo system follows KI's three-tier structure:

1. **Openers**: Moves that start combos
   - Light attacks (safe, limited damage)
   - Heavy attacks (risky, high reward)
   - Special moves (context dependent)

2. **Linkers**: Moves that continue combos
   - Extend combo potential
   - Build meter and damage
   - Create mix-up opportunities

3. **Enders**: Moves that finish combos
   - Maximum damage output
   - Special effects (knockdown, meter drain)
   - Risk/reward decision points

#### Frame Data Philosophy
All moves include precise frame data:
- **Startup**: Frames before attack becomes active
- **Active**: Frames the attack can hit
- **Recovery**: Frames after attack ends
- **Advantage**: Frame difference on hit/block

This data is exposed to players for competitive depth.

#### Meter System
- **Meter Building**: Gained through attacks, taking damage, and combos
- **Meter Usage**: Super moves, enhanced specials, combo breakers
- **Strategic Resource**: Risk/reward decisions for meter spending

### Combo Breaker System
Following KI's innovative approach:
- **Timing-based breaks**: Predict opponent's combo timing
- **Lockout penalty**: Failed breaks leave you vulnerable
- **Mind games**: Creates psychological pressure in combos

## üé® Visual Design

### Art Direction
- **Stylized realism**: Appealing to both casual and competitive players
- **Clear readability**: Easy to parse during fast-paced action
- **Consistent theming**: Unified visual language across all content

### UI/UX Philosophy
- **Minimal HUD**: Focus on the action
- **Immediate feedback**: Clear hit confirmations and state changes
- **Accessibility**: Colorblind-friendly palettes and subtitle support

### Animation Principles
- **Clarity over flash**: Animations serve gameplay first
- **Consistent timing**: Animation frames match gameplay frames
- **Anticipation and recovery**: Clear startup and cooldown animations

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Engine Choice: Godot 4
**Reasons for selection:**
- Open source (aligns with project goals)
- Strong 2D performance
- Built-in networking support
- C# scripting support
- Cross-platform deployment
- Active development community

### Data-Driven Design

#### Character System
Characters are defined in JSON files containing:
```json
{
  "health": 1000,
  "walkSpeed": 150,
  "moves": {
    "normals": { ... },
    "specials": { ... },
    "supers": { ... }
  }
}
```

Benefits:
- **Hot-swappable**: Changes without code recompilation
- **Version control friendly**: Text-based diffs
- **Modding support**: Community can create characters
- **Balancing**: Rapid iteration on move properties

#### Modular Content Pipeline
- **Character DLC**: Drop-in JSON + asset packages
- **Stage DLC**: Plug-and-play stage definitions
- **Music DLC**: Separate audio content packages

### Netcode Architecture

#### Rollback Netcode (GGPO-style)
**Core Concepts:**
- **Deterministic simulation**: Identical inputs produce identical outputs
- **State serialization**: Save/load game states for rollback
- **Input prediction**: Predict remote player inputs
- **Lag compensation**: Roll back to correct states when predictions fail

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Deterministic game logic**: Fixed-point math, consistent physics
2. **Input buffering**: Store input history for rollback
3. **State management**: Lightweight state saving/loading
4. **Network synchronization**: Frame-locked input exchange

#### Network Architecture
```
Client A ‚Üê‚Üí Game Server ‚Üê‚Üí Client B
```
- **Peer-to-peer for matches**: Direct connection for lowest latency
- **Dedicated servers for matchmaking**: Centralized player matching
- **Relay servers for problematic connections**: Fallback for NAT issues

### Performance Targets
- **60 FPS**: Locked framerate for competitive consistency
- **Low latency**: <50ms total input lag (local + network)
- **Stable performance**: No frame drops during intense action
- **Memory efficiency**: Support for lower-end hardware

## üé≠ Character Design Framework

### Character Archetypes
Following fighting game conventions:

1. **Shoto** (Ryu-type): Balanced, fundamental-focused
2. **Grappler**: High damage, close-range specialist
3. **Zoner**: Long-range control, keep-away specialist
4. **Rushdown**: High-speed pressure, mix-up focused
5. **Technical**: Complex mechanics, high skill ceiling

### Character Uniqueness
Each character should have:
- **Unique mechanics**: Special systems or properties
