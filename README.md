# Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike - Complete TypeScript Implementation

![SF III Third Strike logo](3s_logo.webp)

A comprehensive TypeScript implementation of Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike featuring modern game architecture, ethical player retention systems, and complete conversion from the original C/C++ codebase.

## üéÆ What We've Built

This project represents a complete transformation from a PlayStation 2 decompilation project into a modern, production-ready fighting game system with industry-leading ethical monetization and player retention features.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### Core Game Engine (`src/core/`)
- **GameEngine.ts**: Main PlayCanvas-based game engine with integrated systems
- **CharacterManager.ts**: Character loading, configuration, and state management
- **CombatSystem.ts**: Frame-perfect fighting game mechanics with hitbox collision
- **InputManager.ts**: Multi-input support (keyboard, gamepad) with special move detection

### TypeScript Conversion (`src/typescript/`)
Complete conversion of 495+ C files into modern TypeScript architecture:

- **Audio System**: ADX codec implementation with CRI filesystem support
- **Graphics Pipeline**: HD2D sprite rendering with modern shaders
- **Memory Management**: PS2-compatible memory allocation with web optimization
- **Effect System**: Unified particle and visual effects management
- **Character System**: Data-driven character movesets and animations
- **Platform Layer**: Cross-platform compatibility using WebGL/WebAPIs

### Backend Services (`src/backend/`)
Production-ready microservices architecture:

#### Identity Service (Port 3001)
- JWT authentication and user management
- GDPR/CCPA compliant consent management
- Communication preference controls
- Account deletion and data export

#### Progression Service (Port 3002)
- Server-side XP validation and level calculation
- Prestige system with cosmetic-only rewards
- Objective assignment and completion tracking
- Idempotent reward grants with transaction safety

#### Analytics Service (Port 3003)
- High-throughput event ingestion (batch and stream)
- Ethical churn prediction with transparent explanations
- A/B testing framework with statistical validity
- Privacy-aware data processing with consent validation

### Client SDK (`src/client/`)
Drop-in TypeScript integration for fighting games:

- **RetentionClient.ts**: Session tracking with offline support
- **MasteryEngine.ts**: Skill-based progression and prestige systems
- **Storefront.ts**: Transparent pricing without virtual currencies
- **Clubs.ts**: Social team formation and mentor matching
- **CoachOverlay.ts**: Contextual gameplay tips and frame data analysis

## üìä Character & Combat System

### Character Data (`data/characters/`)
JSON-driven character configurations with complete frame data:
- **Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Sagat, Zangief, Lei Wulong**
- Frame-accurate move properties (startup/active/recovery)
- Hitbox definitions with damage and advantage calculations
- Combo system integration with canceling properties

### Combat Features
- Frame-perfect collision detection
- Hitstop and blockstun mechanics
- Special move input detection (hadoken, shoryuken, etc.)
- Character-specific move properties and damage scaling

## üõ°Ô∏è Ethical Monetization Framework

### Player Bill of Rights (`docs/player_bill_of_rights.md`)
Industry-leading ethical commitments:
- No pay-to-win mechanics
- Transparent real-money pricing
- No loot boxes or gambling mechanics
- Clear return schedules for limited items
- Complete data privacy protection

### Revenue Model (`docs/economy_no_currency.md`)
- Direct currency pricing (no virtual currency confusion)
- Cosmetic-only monetization (skins, titles, effects)
- Transparent bundle pricing with clear value
- Accessibility-compliant commerce system

## üì± Data Contracts & Analytics

### Event Schemas (`contracts/events/`)
Versioned JSON schemas for comprehensive analytics:
- Session tracking and match outcomes
- Progression grants and store interactions
- Purchase completion with payment methods
- Social club activities and coaching events

### Configuration Management (`contracts/config/`)
- Live operations calendar for events and seasons
- Store catalog with regional pricing support
- Daily/weekly objectives with skill-focused tasks

## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (TypeScript compilation)
- Modern web browser (WebGL support)

### Installation
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run serve
```

### Running Backend Services
```bash
# Start all microservices
cd src/backend
npm install
npm run start:all

# Services run on:
# Identity: http://localhost:3001
# Progression: http://localhost:3002  
# Analytics: http://localhost:3003
```

### Client Integration
```typescript
import { GameEngine } from './src/core/GameEngine';
import { RetentionClient } from './src/client/retention/RetentionClient';

const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas')!;
const engine = new GameEngine(canvas);
await engine.initialize();

const retention = new RetentionClient({
  apiEndpoint: 'http://localhost:3001',
  userId: 'player123'
});
```
