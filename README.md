# Fighting Game Starter

A complete starter project for a live-service fighting game inspired by Killer Instinct (2013) with deep combo systems, rollback netcode, and modular DLC architecture.

## üéÆ Features

- **Engine**: Godot 4 with C# scripting
- **Gameplay**: Killer Instinct-inspired combo system with openers, linkers, and enders
- **Netcode**: Foundation for GGPO-style rollback netcode

   - Click the "Build" button or press `Ctrl+Shift+B`

4. Run the game:
   - Press `F5` or click the "Play" button in Godot

## üéØ Controls

### Player 1 (Keyboard)
- **Movement**: WASD
- **Light Punch**: J
- **Medium Punch**: K
- **Heavy Punch**: L
- **Light Kick**: U
- **Medium Kick**: I
- **Heavy Kick**: O

### Player 2 (Keyboard)
- **Movement**: Arrow Keys

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Systems

- **GameManager**: Central game state and scene management
- **InputManager**: Deterministic input handling for rollback netcode
- **Character System**: Data-driven character loading from JSON files
- **Combo System**: Opener ‚Üí Linker ‚Üí Ender combo structure

### Data-Driven Design

Characters are defined in JSON files located in `data/characters/`. This allows for:
- Easy character balancing
- Modular DLC character additions
- Community modding support

## üé≠ Character System

### Adding New Characters

1. Create a new JSON file in `data/characters/` (see `ryu.json` as template)
2. Define character properties:
   - Basic stats (health, speed, etc.)
   - Move data with frame information
   - Combo routes
   - Animation references

3. Add character sprites to `assets/characters/`
4. The character will automatically appear in character select

### Move Data Structure

Each move includes detailed frame data:
- **Startup Frames**: Time before hitbox becomes active
- **Active Frames**: How long the hitbox remains active
- **Recovery Frames**: Time after hitbox deactivates
- **Advantage**: Frame advantage on hit/block
- **Properties**: Special properties (cancelable, invincible, etc.)

## üîß Building for Distribution

### Development Build
```bash
# In Godot editor
Project > Export > Add Export Template
# Select your target platform and export
```

### Steam Build (SteamPipe Compatible)
The project is structured to support Steam deployment:
1. Export builds to `builds/` directory
2. Configure Steam app ID
3. Use Steamworks SDK for Steam integration

### GitHub Actions CI/CD
Automated builds are configured for:
- Development branch builds
- Tag-based release builds
- Multi-platform exports
