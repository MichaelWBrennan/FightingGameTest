## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Live-Service Infrastructure
```
GitHub Actions ‚Üí Build Pipeline ‚Üí Steam Deployment
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                   ‚Üì
Live Balance ‚Üê Config Updates ‚Üí Client Hotfixes
```

### Character System
Characters defined in JSON with comprehensive data:
```
data/characters/[character_id].json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Archetype & Complexity Classification
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Frame Data & Hitbox Information  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Combo Routes & Move Properties
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Balance Multipliers & Adjustments
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Telemetry Integration Points
```

### Modular Systems
Each major fighting game mechanic operates as independent module:
- Roman Cancel System (toggleable)
- Parry & Defend System (configurable windows)
- Combo Scaling Engine (adjustable parameters)
- Balance Manager (live config updates)
- Telemetry System (automatic data collection)

## üé≠ Character Development

### Creating New Characters
1. Copy `CHARACTER_DEV_TEMPLATE/` folder
2. Edit `character_config.json` with character data
3. Add animations and sound effects
4. Test using developer console: `spawn [character_id]`
5. Iterate based on balance telemetry

### Archetype Guidelines
- **Easy**: 3-5 frame startup moves, simple inputs
- **Medium**: 6-10 frame startup, quarter-circle motions
- **Hard**: 8-15 frame startup, complex inputs
- **Expert**: Variable timing, unique mechanics

See `CHARACTER_DEV_TEMPLATE/README.md` for detailed guidelines.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Balance Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Competitive Integrity**: No pay-to-win, all characters viable
2. **Anti-Power-Creep**: Strict limits on damage, speed, health
3. **Risk/Reward Consistency**: High reward requires high risk

### Balance Process
- **Quarterly Major Patches**: Character adjustments, system changes
- **Monthly Minor Patches**: Frame data tweaks, damage adjustments  
- **Live Hotfixes**: Critical fixes via config updates
- **Community Feedback**: Beta testing, surveys, tournament data

See `BALANCE.md` for complete balance philosophy and guidelines.

## üîß Building for Distribution
